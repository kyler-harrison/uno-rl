dqn:
	is it just a nn that ouputs to 108 neurons? where each is the predicted q-value?

	so, run state through network and select max predicted q val of valid card in agent's hand?

	should i not do a unique index for every card? so, that way if a card is the same, it has the same index?
	reduce dimensionality in network? would it even matter? ex. i would expect agent to learn there is no difference
    between idx 99 and idx 100 if they're both a blue 3. but then again, maybe the amount of cards could matter
	somehow, like knowing that idx 99 and 100 have been played is useful bc maybe that wouldn't be captured if
	you use non-unique indexes? idk
